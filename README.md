## What is this?

DistributedHashCracker is an open-source platform that revolutionizes cryptographic hash cracking by enabling distributed computing across user-supplied cloud infrastructure. Instead of being limited to single machines or expensive centralized services, researchers can now leverage their own AWS accounts for scalable, cost-effective parallel hash cracking.

## The Problem We Solve

Current hash cracking solutions face critical limitations:
- **Single Machine Bottlenecks**: Desktop tools limited by local hardware
- **Expensive Services**: Centralized platforms with high operational costs
- **Trust Issues**: Security researchers hesitant to use black-box services
- **Scale Limitations**: No easy way to distribute workload across hundreds of containers

## Our Solution

Submit a hash through our web interface, configure your AWS credentials and resource preferences, then watch as the platform automatically:

- Provisions distributed compute infrastructure via Terraform
- Deploys containerized hash cracking engines
- Intelligently divides the search space across all containers
- Provides real-time progress monitoring and cost tracking
- Automatically cleans up resources when complete

## Key Features

 **Dynamic Scaling** - From single containers to hundreds of instances  
 **Cost Control** - Use your own AWS account, set strict budget limits  
 **Smart Distribution** - Optimal work allocation reduces cracking time  
 **Real-time Monitoring** - Live progress tracking and performance metrics  
 **Security First** - Open source, minimal permissions, credential isolation  
 **Multi-Algorithm** - MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256, NTLM, and more  

## Architecture Overview

The platform uses a coordinator-worker pattern where a central service distributes work chunks to containerized crackers, automatically handling failures and load balancing.
