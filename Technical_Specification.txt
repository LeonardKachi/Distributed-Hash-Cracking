Distributed Hash Cracking Platform - Technical Specification

Executive Summary

This document outlines a revolutionary open-source platform that enables on-demand, distributed hash cracking using user-supplied cloud infrastructure. Unlike traditional tools limited to single machines or expensive centralized services, this platform allows users to leverage their own AWS accounts for scalable, cost-effective cryptographic research and security testing.

Platform Overview

Core Concept
Users submit cryptographic hashes through a web interface, configure their AWS credentials and resource preferences, then the platform automatically provisions distributed compute infrastructure to perform parallel brute-force attacks. The system intelligently divides the search space across multiple containers, dramatically reducing cracking time while keeping costs under user control.

Key Differentiators

* Zero Infrastructure Costs: Users bring their own AWS accounts
* Open Source: Complete transparency for security-critical operations
* Dynamic Scaling: From single containers to hundreds of instances
* Intelligent Distribution: Optimal work allocation across compute resources
* Real-time Monitoring: Live progress tracking and cost estimation

User Experience Flow

Initial Setup
1. Account Configuration: User provides AWS account credentials via IAM role assumption
2. Credential Validation: System verifies permissions and resource access
3. Budget Setting: User defines spending limits and auto-shutdown triggers

Job Submission
1. Hash Input: User pastes hash value and selects algorithm (MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256, etc.)
2. Resource Configuration:
   * Instance types (compute-optimized, memory-optimized, GPU-enabled)
   * Container count and resource allocation
   * Maximum runtime and cost limits
3. Attack Configuration:
   * Brute force parameters (character sets, length ranges)
   * Dictionary attack options
   * Hybrid attack strategies
   
Execution Monitoring
1. Real-time Dashboard: Live container status, progress percentage, estimated completion
2. Cost Tracking: Running costs, projected total, budget remaining
3. Performance Metrics: Hashes per second, container efficiency, resource utilization

Results and Cleanup
1. Success Notification: Plain text result delivery via multiple channels
2. Partial Results: Progress snapshots for long-running jobs
3. Automatic Cleanup: Infrastructure termination, cost reporting, log archival

Technical Implementation Details

Work Distribution Algorithm
Static Distribution
Total Search Space: 62^8 (alphanumeric, 8 characters)
Available Containers: 10
Per Container: 62^8 / 10 = 2.18 × 10^13 combinations each


Dynamic Distribution (Recommended)
Coordinator maintains work queue with smaller chunks (1M-10M combinations)
Containers request work when idle
Failed/slow containers don't block overall progress
Automatic load balancing based on container performance


AWS Infrastructure Pattern

  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::PLATFORM-ACCOUNT:role/HashCrackingService"
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
      "Condition": {
        "StringEquals": {
          "sts:ExternalId": "USER-UNIQUE-TOKEN"
        }
      }
    }
  ]

Resource Tagging Strategy
Project: HashCrackingPlatform
JobId: {unique-job-identifier}
UserId: {user-identifier}
AutoCleanup: true
MaxRuntime: {user-specified-hours}
CostLimit: {user-specified-dollars}


Container Orchestration Options

Option 1: ECS with Fargate
Advantages: Serverless, automatic scaling, simplified management Disadvantages: Higher per-container cost, limited customization
Option 2: EKS with EC2 Spot Instances
Advantages: Maximum cost efficiency, full control, hybrid workloads Disadvantages: Complexity overhead, spot interruption handling
Option 3: Direct EC2 with Docker Swarm
Advantages: Simplicity, direct control, lower orchestration overhead Disadvantages: Manual scaling, limited fault tolerance

Security Considerations

Credential Management
* Never store user AWS credentials permanently
* Use short-lived STS tokens with minimal required permissions
* Implement credential rotation and expiration
* Audit all credential usage and API calls

Network Security
* Isolated VPCs for each user's infrastructure
* Minimal security group rules (outbound only for most containers)
* No public IP addresses for worker containers
* Encrypted communication between all components

Data Protection
* Hash values treated as sensitive data
* Results encrypted in transit and at rest
* Automatic deletion of all data after job completion
* No logging of plain text results
